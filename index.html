    <h1>The invisible neighbours</h1>
    <h2>
      How does Canadian First Nation and Inuit communities'<br />quality of life compare to
      the rest of the country?
    </h2>
  </div>
  <div id="parent_intro">
    <div id="lead">
      Canada’s quality of life is among the best in the world, according to the <a href ="http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/countries/canada/" target="_blank">Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development</a> — but the benefits are not shared equally. 
      <br /><br />
      The Signal examined the quality of life of communities across Canada, using the Community Well-Being Index. It combines indicators on education, labour force activity, income and housing to give every Canadian community a well-being "score". The analysis shows just how deep disparities really are in Canada.
      <br /><br />
      Nine out of ten Indigenous communities lie in the bottom 10% of the country when measuring quality of life using this index, the Signal analysis found. 
      <br /><br />
      This is hardly surprising to Claire Durand, sociology professor at the University of Montreal. "A certain number of conditions must be united for a First Nation community to have a high well being score, because otherwise, there is an overwhelming number of obstacles to overcome." And while Inuit communities generally score slightly higher indexes, their average is far from the non-Indigenous scores.
      <br /><br />
      The 2016 Census data shows that Indigenous people living in isolated communities have a worse access to education, lower rates of employment and lower earnings than non-Indigenous communities.
      <br /><br />
      It is important to note that other factors are significant when it comes to quality of life for Indigenous people. Physical and emotional health, cultural continuity and environmental conservation all impact their well-being, and yet are not included in this index.
      <br /><br />
      The figures vary widely across the provinces. Select yours to learn more about it.

          ones, but lower than the non-Aboriginal ones. This means that, if there were three categories, the

        Here is how the indicators below were calculated, all from the 2016 census data. For more information on the methodology behind these calculations, read the CWB Index 2011 <a href="https://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1345816651029/1345816742083" target="_blank">Report</a>.

        <b>Income:</b> It uses the income per capita, and converts dollars of income per capita into logarithms, to account for the fact that those who occupy lower income strata will benefit more from additional income than those at higher income levels.
        <br><br>
        <b>Education:</b> It is composed of the proportion of 20+ years old who obtained at least a high school certificate and the proportion of 25+ years old that has a university degree.
        <br><br>
        <b>Dwellings:</b> It is composed of the proportion of people living in a dwelling that contains no more than one person per room and the proportion of people living in a dwelling that is not in need of major repairs.
        <br><br>
        <b>Labour Force:</b> It uses the proportion of 20-65 years old that was involved in the labour force during the week preceding census day (which accounts for labour force participation) and the proportion of 20-65 years old that was employed that week.

      <p><b>Methodology</b></p>
      <p>
        The First Nation communities, or “on-reserve”, are the census subdivisions which had one of the six types
        legally affiliated with First Nations or Indian bands by Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada. A total of
        364 First Nations communities were analysed for the purpose of this study. The “off-reserve” category includes
        all
        the subdivisions that were not a part of that first category.
      </p>
      <p>
        The index is calculated from a sampling of all residents of a community, not only those of First Nations
        ancestry. It also captures the aggregate index of each subdivision and therefore does not necessarily reflect
        the diversity within a community.
      </p>
      <p>
        Quality of life was calculated by the Community Well-Being Index, which combines indicators on education,
        labour force activity, income and housing to give each community a well-being “score", ranging from 1 to 100.
        The
        actual range through the country is 15 to 69.
      </p>
      <p>
        Data was insufficient for Yukon, the Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Newfoundland and Labrador and Prince
        Edward Island to analyse, so these provinces and territories were taken off for statistical purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
        Subdivisions with a small population (below the 250 people threshold) were suppressed because it lacked income
        data. Some bands, like the Mohawks in Kahnawake, have also refused to take part in the Census. In other cases,
        since income information is obtained from the Canada Revenue Agency and not everyone who live on a reserve
        will file a tax return, the quality of the data is not as good.
      </p>
      <p>
        The lack of data especially affected the results of British Columbia (18 873 people), Ontario (6715 people),
        Alberta (3344 people)and Saskatchewan (2623 people).
      </p>
      <p>
        Quality of life is qualified differently from a culture to another, and the CWBI was used as common grounds
        with the available data from Statistics Canada. Still, it is important to note that other factors are
        significant
        when it comes to quality of life for First Nations. Physical and emotional health, cultural continuity and
        environmental conservation all impact the well-being of people in First Nation communities, and yet are not
        included in this index.
